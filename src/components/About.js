      <p>Hi, I’m Bilal!</p>
      <p>
        I’m a Master’s student studying computer science at the University of
        Pennsylvania. In 2021, I graduated from McGill University, where I
        studied physiology and math and competed for McGill’s track and field
        team. During my undergraduate studies, I was fortunate enough to partake
        in coursework and research that helped me re-discover my interests
        through the lens of computing. My transition to computer science was
        inspired by these transformative experiences.

        Things I particularly like: wearable technology, Chris Paul, corgis, and
        good music.
